## How going guys ! ðŸ˜€
**This is Lucas and I'm take a framework to you look the decripiton to know more**
    
    
    I did this framework just to earn to learning about K_means, that was a simple framework 
    just try to do and import my programmer development skills.


I used k_means to created clusts to imporve the analyze if the new client can or not take a new loan. Was used a database about banks and finance.

 this dataset was split in train and test  and with K_means we can to put a new client and the framework will place in one of clust and the main to decide if the new client can to take the loan or not.
